# DevOps with Docker 21

This is my repository for the course exercises. More details about the course can be found on this page:
[https://devopswithdocker.com/](https://devopswithdocker.com/)

# Note:

- Some exercises are in multiple files inside a folder. For example, if the exercise required submitting a Dockerfile and a command, the command is in a file called `command` or `commands` and the Dockerfile is its own file. Otherwise the exercise is most likely just stored within one `.md` file in the root of the part directory.
