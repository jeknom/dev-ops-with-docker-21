# How containers are utilized in development

The app is a Next.js app that uses MySQL to store data and Adminer to manage it. There are two docker-compose files in the root of the project. The other for development and the other for production. The development version when built will mount with a shared volume and an `ENVIRONMENT` variable that is set to development. When started, the app will run in development mode, watching for any file changes. As all the files are shared through the volume, it will pick up any changes to those files and trigger compilation. Due to the app being Dockerized it is very easy for other developers to set up their development environment. For more details, check the docs on the repository.
